*A Julia package for simulating statistical mechanics with massively-parallel Monte Carlo methods.*

This package is currently under development. I hope to have it up and running soon. Stay tuned for details.

## Citing 

**When the time comes...**

See [`CITATION.bib`](CITATION.bib) for the relevant reference(s).
